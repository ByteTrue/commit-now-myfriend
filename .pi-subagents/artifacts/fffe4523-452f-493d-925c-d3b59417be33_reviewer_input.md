# Task for reviewer

Pre-output audit of GitHub #35 and `.cs/epics/001-o-offline-commit-flow/artifacts/035/`. Read issue #35, Epic relevant section, all 035 manifests/prompts/rubrics/scripts, and the frozen pilot/manifest under `/tmp/cnm-pierce35/data`. Do not edit anything and do not inspect source commit messages. Find only blockers that could create a false GO, violate the user's approved constraints, leak prior evaluation data, make the pilot non-reproducible, or invalidate independent double-blind review. Verify actual scripts against issue claims. Report concise severity-ranked findings with exact paths/lines and a GO/FIX-BEFORE-OUTPUT verdict. This review itself occurs before freeze/teacher output.

## Acceptance Contract
Acceptance level: attested
Completion is not accepted from prose alone. End with a structured acceptance report.

Criteria:
- criterion-1: Return concrete findings with file paths and severity when applicable

Required evidence: review-findings, residual-risks

Finish with a fenced JSON block tagged `acceptance-report` in this shape:
Use empty arrays when no items apply; array fields contain strings unless object entries are shown.
`criteriaSatisfied[].status` must be exactly one of: satisfied, not-satisfied, not-applicable.
`commandsRun[].result` must be exactly one of: passed, failed, not-run.
`manualNotes` and `notes` are optional strings; an empty string means no note and does not satisfy `manual-notes` evidence.
